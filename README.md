# machin-learning-image-reconstruction
To find the missing part of an image, we will automatically fill in the missing pixels in the image.  We use two approaches.  In the first approach, we look for the nearest patch in the intact region of the patch containing the missing pixels. The closest is defined by a distance, for example the Euclidean distance.  In the second approach( PDE (Partially Differential Equations)), the missing part of the boundaries in the center of the distortion is filled step by step.
